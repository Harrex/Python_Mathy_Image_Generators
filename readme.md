If you want to edit any of these, you'll have to look through the code. This is just a hobby project for me to practice some parts of python that I don't usually get to mess with.

## The Mandelbrot Set
This is a basic generator for the mandelbrot set. The colors are based on how many iterations of the equation $z_{n+1} = z_{n}^{2} + C$ it takes to pass 10,000 for the complex value C.

It uses colors from the catpuccin-mocha theme.
